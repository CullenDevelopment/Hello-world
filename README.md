# Hello-world
Hello World - Hello everyone!
My name is Paul and I am new to programming. I started off with a little Python but after some thought, decided that I would try to go a little deeper. Many of the higher level languages are based on C, so I decided to try and get a basic knowledge of C first in the hope that would give me greater insight into C++, Java and Python with the intention of going into much greater depth with Java. I hope that I can pull it off; it's a bit of a tall order but I shall give it my best shot. I am still working from books and I am going to need quite a bit of support but in time, as I continue my journey, I will be able to reciprocate.

Since last time I wrote I have been accepted for a scholarship on a NanoDegree on the Android basics track from Udacity and Google. I have been at it for just over a month and it is going rather well, if a little challenging at times. More updates to follow. I should be in a position to commit the code for my projects soon.
